# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:  
- **Setosa**  
- **Versicolor**  
- **Virginica**  

The model is trained on the famous **Iris dataset**, which consists of four features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- Python 3.13  
- NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for model training)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)
