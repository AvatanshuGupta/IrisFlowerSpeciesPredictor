# Iris Flower Classification 

## Project Overview  
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:  
- **Setosa**  
- **Versicolor**  
- **Virginica**  

The model is trained on the famous **Iris dataset**, which consists of four features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  


##  Technologies Used  
- Python 3.13  
- tkinter (For UI)
- NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for model training)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)  

## Models Used for Testing 
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
By using these models we got accuracy around 99% to 100%
## Correlation Matrix
A **correlation matrix** was generated to understand the relationships between different features of the dataset.  

**Key Observations:**  
- **Petal Length and Petal Width** have the strongest correlation.  
- **Sepal Width** shows a weaker correlation with other features.

## How To Open The Project File
To use the model and get predictions, open the file named **ModelUi.py** in the main folder
